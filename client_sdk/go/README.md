# FPC Client SDK for Go

The FPC Client SDK for Go builds on top of the [Fabric Client SDK Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go).
For more documentation, see [godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-private-chaincode/client_sdk/go/)
and a [sample applications](../../samples/applications/) to illustrate it use.
The FPC [Helloworld Tutorial](../../samples/chaincodes/helloworld) also demonstrates the usage of the FPC Client SDK for Go.

## Testing
Before running tests, please make sure you have built the chaincode samples (i.e., run `make -C $FPC_PATH/samples/chaincode`) as they are used for testing.
