                    Note that i dropped here the old MVP version which would have had signature in ccrsp_msg.
                    The corresponding validation would essentially be replacing below with content of
                    group enclave endorsement validation, but read/write-set extracted from ledger rather 
                    than from ccrsp_msg.

                    fpc-vscc is a validation plugin associated with each FPC Chaincode.
                    Any failure below will result in an invalidation of the transaction.

                note right of ECC1
                    The enclave's signature was already verified against the (enclave's) PeerCertificate.
                    Similarly, the enclave endorsement policy is encoded in the (fabric) endorsement policy
                    and already validate.
                    The only step required to verify is that the endorsement comes from a correctly
                    registered enclave for that chaincode
