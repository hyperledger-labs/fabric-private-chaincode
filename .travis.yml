  #   Note: 
  #   - travis of couse does an implicit clobber but adding it here makes sure
  #     it works properly, also to make sure below is clean-slate
  #   - docker buildkit is not supported by travis, so override our default.
  #     (twice, once for each make invocation.)
  #   - to not run afoul of the travis log file limit we build docker stuff in quiet mode
  #     (which still should show log on errors ...)
